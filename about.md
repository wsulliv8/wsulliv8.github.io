Prior to commissioning into the US Navy submarine force, I spent four years at the University of Notre Dame where I studied Computer Science. Those four years provided me a strong foundation in the core theory of Computer Science including data structures, algorithms, and operating systems. I also had the chance to study computer vision (before the explosion in popularity of AI) and found the theory intriguing; the class sparked my interest in machine learning and was a contributing factor in my decision to enroll in the University of Texas at Austin's Master's in Computer Science program. Aside from my studies, I was a member of the Notre Dame cheerleading team; I had an incredible time cheering and performing stunts alongside the leprechaun during football games.

Following undergrad, I entered the submarine force as an Ensign and began naval nuclear training in preparation for my first submarine. The nuclear pipeline is no joke; it involves six months of masters-level coursework in nuclear engineering, six months of hands-on training at a shore-based submarine reactor, and three months of tactical training.

The bar is raised in terms of difficulty and expectations once an officer arrives at his first boat. I was lucky to be assigned to the USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23), one of the three Seawolf class submarines, during an operational period. "Operational" for the Jimmy Carter translates to roughly 600 days underwater in the three years I was onboard, so time above water to be with family vastly increased in value.

Submarine officers typically have to juggle two primary duties: standing watch as a watch officer (Engineering Officer of the Watch and Officer of the Deck) and leading a division of sailors as division officer. Both duties offer a variety of complex leadership and intellectual challenges.

The Engineering Officer of the Watch is responsible for safe operation of the reactor plant while the Officer of the Deck's responsibility expands to the entire ship. Nothing teaches a 24-year old ownership faster than driving a $4 billion dollar warship and being directly responsible for hundreds of lives.

I had the opportunity to lead three divisions during my time: Machinery, Electrical, and Chemistry/Radiological. Each division had between six and twenty sailors and held responsibility for a specific area of reactor/steam plant maintenance. As division officer, I was responsible for leading the division in proper planning/execution of plant maintenance, responding to certain division-specific casualties, and helping each sailor reach his/her fullest potential.

My final duty onboard placed me second in command of the 68-person engineering department as the Assistant Engineer (AENG). As AENG, I helped plan and execute three multi-million dollar maintenance availabilities, coordinated major nuclear testing periods, revised the ship's standard operating procedures, and oversaw high-risk reactor plant drills. This period was the most mentally exhausting and stressful of my time onboard, but it also helped me realize the most personal growth; in no small part due to my direct superior (the Engineer).

I left the boat in September of 2024, having had my fill of submarine operations. I currently teach other nuclear submarine officers as a Prospective Nuclear Engineer Officer (PNEO) instructor at Trident Training Facility (TTF), Bangor. In this position, I leverage years of experience operating submarine reactors to help mid-tour junior officers pass a highly-demanding three month course on advanced nuclear principles. So far, it has been a valuable opportunity to expand my knowledge base and develop my interpersonal skills.

Concurrent with my nuclear instructor position, I am a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin where I am specializing in machine learning with classes on advanced linear algebra, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. I intend to get out of the Navy in late 2026 and pursue a career as a software engineer, a field that I am extremely passionate for.

I decided to start a blog to share some of the knowledge that I gain in the master's program and increase my involvement in the Computer Science community. I hope you find some enjoyment in my posts and please don't hesitate to reach out.
