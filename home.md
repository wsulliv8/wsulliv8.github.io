**Greetings!** I am a nuclear submarine officer working at Trident Training Facility (TTF) near Seattle. I recently spent three years on the USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) and prior to that I did my undergrad in Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame.

I am currently enrolled in the Computer Science graduate program at the University of Texas at Austin and spending the majority of my free time expanding my knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

Aside from academics, I enjoy weightlifting, spending time outdoors (hiking, snowboarding, kayaking, etc.), and visiting family.
